Scao and Rush (2021) empirically show that prompting is often worth 100s of data\\npoints on average across classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.\\n10.7 Transferability of Prompts\\nUnderstanding the extent to which prompts are speciÔ¨Åc to the model and improving the transferability of prompts are\\nalso important topics. (Perez et al., 2021) show that prompts selected under tuned few-shot learning scenario (where\\none has a larger validation set to choose prompts) generalize well across models of similar sizes while prompts\\nselected under true few-shot learning scenario (where one only has a few training samples) do not generalize as\\neffectively as the former setting among models with similar sizes.
