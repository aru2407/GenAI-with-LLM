# GenAI-with-LLM

[1. Query Retrieval Using OpenAI Embeddings and ChromaDB](https://github.com/aru2407/GenAI-with-LLM/blob/main/Query_Retrieval.ipynb)
This notebook performs RAG by making use of OpenAI embeddings and ChromaDB for vector store. I have used a few model papers related to GenAI with LLMs for the retrieval. You can check out the [data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/supplement/zlpBf/week-2-resources) which I have used for the retrieval.
