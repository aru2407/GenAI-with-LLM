1. [Query Retrieval Using OpenAI Embeddings and ChromaDB](https://github.com/aru2407/GenAI-with-LLM/blob/main/Query_Retrieval.ipynb)
This notebook performs RAG by making use of OpenAI embeddings and ChromaDB for vector store. I have used a few model papers related to GenAI with LLMs for the retrieval. You can check out the [data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/supplement/zlpBf/week-2-resources) which I have used for the retrieval.
2. [SQL Querying](https://github.com/aru2407/GenAI-with-LLM/blob/main/SQL%20Querying.ipynb) 
This notebook is aimed to query a database by using OpenAI and Gemini Pro 1.5 model. First, I'm creating a database with a sample table and records, and I'm making some queries. The model is able to convert my text to SQL queries and is able to display answer.
